<p class="cap2" style="font-size: 25px;color:#101c73;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;text-transform: capitalize;"><strong>Why should you join Dream Chasers</strong></p>
<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#000000;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">1.The most important reason for joining a centre is the faculty.
 In Dream Chasers the training is done by a highly experienced IIM Alumnus who is training students full time and is giving great results year after year. 
 Ask yourself if you would like to learn from the best faculty or from someone who is free on that day (Check the educational qualification of the faculty 
 in other centres and you will see the difference)</p>
</div>


<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#095ae5;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">2.Students have to attend classes till the faculty is
 satisfied that the students have learnt all the concepts.Here even after the course is over, we ask all the students to come to class and attend the chapters again and again 
 till we are satisfied and the students are satisfied. We will not send the student away saying the topics have been done or so many hours are over but we will keep training
 them till they become good.(Even if it takes twice the normal duration or thrice the normal duration ,they have to attend till they learn all concepts). Hundreds of students
 have got results as this is not done by other centres. Other centres have fixed duration like 6 weeks after which the students should leave.
Here we make students come for 3 or 4 months also if required and make them successful.</p>
</div>

<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#000000;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">3.Personalised attention is given to all the students in the class .Everyday ,we will give the students a target to finish and come before the next class which if followed will give results. We will follow up with each student on how much they have finished</p>
</div>

<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#095ae5;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">4.Revision of basic concepts for weak students at no extra fees..</p>
</div>



<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#000000;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">5.
Excellent Feedback of old students.See feedback of our old students by going to the feedback section.</p>
</div>

<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#095ae5;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">6.Free demo class for you to assess the faculty . Then you can pay. So you can be sure there is no risk .</p>
</div>

<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#000000;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">7.Video recordings of all important chapters are there in our centre. The student can view the video in the centre and revise tough chapters many times. No other centre offers this.</p>
</div>

<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#095ae5;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">8.15 hours every week till you become good. By attending so many hours every week,you will surely become good. In 1 month you would have attended 60 hours in class and you can attend more till you become good at no extra fees</p>
</div>

<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#000000;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">9.Special sessions on banking awareness from the basics
</p>
</div></div>

<p style="font-size:22px;font-family:Montserrat;text-align:center;padding:10px;color:#062966;">
What more do you want ????? <br></p><p style="font-size:18px;font-family:Montserrat;text-align:center;padding:10px;color:#095ae5;">If you find something that we are not doing but our competitors are doing ,kindly tell us. We will try to add that also.

Sathish - Placed in State Bank Of India <br>
PSG College of Technology, coimbatore  </p></p>
<center><div class="textstyle">
Hi , I am Sathish. I am currently working with State Bank of India as a probationary officer. I joined the classes a year ago. As i was working in a software industry, i needed an institution which would provide special care and attention to every student and giving space and time to build on their own strengths and weakness. And i am glad that both my expectations were met here. I have seen people giving you a set of question Papers and asked you solve only those questions without even explaining or provide you with some booklets (not even updated) with that their job is done. At the best you will get to take few tests. They will never even care about you and how you are progressing. Contrary to that here you have an oppurtunity to get different materials (printed and video) to learn and practice. There are many practice sets available in the class rooms, you can use those materials any number of times any day. The door will be always opened for you, which you never get anywhere. Even he (SriGanesh) will get new books (for the institution only :0 ), if you find a good one available in the market and suggest him to buy. And the most important thing there is no time limit for your course, you can avail his service till you get satisfied with your performances. Careerwise you can get lot of good advices and directions from him. One more good thing is he is always open for your suggestions, irrespective of your age and position. People may think I am exaggerating, but these are my own experiences with the institution for the past one year. 
If you see this message, then you are ended in the right place. Grab this opportunity with both hands. Follow your own instincts not others.</div>

Lourdhu ilakya - Cleared SBI PO 
2013 batch </p>
<center><div class="textstyle">I joined dream chasers in Jan 2008 for my placement training as advised by many of my seniors and friends. Only after I started taking classes from Sri Ganesh sir, I did understand the truth behind what they had said. His method of teaching is exceptional. At Dream chasers we are allowed to attend classes for various topics until we are confident of that topic. Our sir did not just stop with teaching us concepts but also motivated us to solve as many number problems as we could. He also taught us interpersonal skills,Grammar usages in English for competitive exams, and I got placed in Infosys Technologies. When I decided to give SBI PO,I attended his classes and followed all his guidance and I cleared the written examination conducted on April 28,2013.
 My sincere advice for anyone aspiring to clear any competitive exams is to just take his guidance and achieve whatever they want to.</div>

Arul Vel Arasan
 	 
 	
IIFT (2010-2012 batch)<br> Panimalar College of Engg. (2008 batch C.Sc)
<center><div class="textstyle">I am Arul. I am working in Cognizant Technology Solutions as a Software engineer.If 
	I would have not met a great person named Mr. Sriganesh of Dream Chasers at right time I
	would have been a normal Software engineer throughout my life without having any big goals to achieve. Yes, its true. I know Mr. Sriganesh for the past 6 years. Its he who motivated me to take CAT and top B-School exams. Initially I thought that I could not clear such difficult exams because of my not so good educational background. But he is a dynamic force of motivation, and whenever I speak to him I felt much more motivated and he made me to improve in all aspects. I can say he is a maestro in Maths, English, Group discussion and Interview training. Yes, its because of him I have got final admission in one of the reputed B-Schools IIFT(Indian Institute Of Foreign Trade) for MBA in International Business. In my family I am the first person to get a top B-School admission. I know very well that it is Mr. Sriganesh who created a new and competitive destiny for me. I have never seen such a capable person like Mr.Sriganesh. It is he who gave me moral support and training throughout my tiring journey. I am very happy to say that he is the person who made me join the elite group of B-School league. Mr. Sriganesh is a person who makes significant changes in people`s life! Yes, if anyone would like to achieve great goals like clearing CAT and competitive exams Dream Chasers is a best place to get trained, as you get trained directly from IIM Calcutta alumni Mr.Sriganesh. I am very sure that you will never get trained in any other institute directly from IIM graduates.
