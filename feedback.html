Shruthy -99.53 percentile in CAT 2011 - Final offers from 10 IIM's - Joined IIM Calcutta -Full time Student of Dream Chasers
National University of Singapore C.Sc. 2011 batch</p>
<p style="color:gray;">I attended CAT classes in Dream Chasers.. And I am really glad that I made that choice. As I was studying in Singapore, I could not attend classes throughout the year, so Sri Ganesh helped me by taking special classes for me, so that I'd be familiar with all topics during the three months I was in Chennai. Even after I left to SIngapore, Sri Ganesh took revision classes for me over Skype and was constantly updated about my progress and study plan. Not only is his teaching great, but Sri Ganesh also ensures that all his students are comfortable with his pace, and students are always welcome to ask questions or express difficulties. Individual attention was given to all of us and special guidance was given to tackle the topics we were weak in. Sincerity and passion are greatly valued in Dream Chasers. Sri Ganesh also ensures that all topics are covered and students take adequate number of mocks before the D-Day. He has been a great source of motivation and inspiration, and more than everything else, a very good friend. Dream Chasers provided me with the necessary knowledge and confidence which helped me score 99.57 percentile in CAT, which helped me fetch calls from 10 IIMs. I hope Dream Chasers reaches out to many more students and many more students are able to realize their dreams.

Vijayaraj 96.99 percentile in CAT 2013 Madras Institute of Technology -Aeronautical Engineering 2012 batch -Joined IIM Calcutta 2014 -2016 batch
 - Final offer from Multiple IIM's - Full time Student of Dream Chasers</p>
<p style="color:gray;">I am vijayaraj.As I studied in Tamil medium I was not very good at verbal and aptitude. I didn't have trust in my own abilities and the level of self-confidence in my own abilities was very low. I always thought that I could not clear CAT exam and it looked like an impossible task for me. But after I met MR.SRIGANESH (mentor in DREAM CHASERSÅ¥) things totally changed. A new self-confidence was born inside me (after seeing his way of teaching and speaking.) I came to believe that everything could be achieved through serious hard work - it does not matter if you are talented or not. My efforts increased to nearly 10 hrs per day mainly because of his motivational and inspirational speech and good guidance. Since my childhood I have not met such a motivational speaker and influential person in my life. His personalised care for each student has helped me much (to clarify the doubts I had). Now I couldn't believe myself, I cleared CAT and ended up with eight calls from IIMs (IIM-Bangalore, Kozhikode and six new IIMs).So I suggest that if anyone wants to achieve their dream, there is no other place like DREAM CHASERSÅ¥ in the world.

Shyam -IFMR (2010-2012) 90 percentile CAT 2009 -Panimalar College of Engg. (2009 batch)- Full time Student of Dream Chasers</p>
<p style="color:gray;">Hi all, I was a student of Dream Chasers for CAT.I Doubt if I can find a better place for CAT Coaching. There are too many institutes & resources which teach you how to solve quantitative aptitude, Logical reasoning & Data Interpretation problems. Looked at from that perspective, Dream Chasers is certainly among the best ones. Things like conceptual clarity, practice papers and problems, short cut solutions and others that you expect from an excellent institute are here. But performing well in CAT is not just about learning to solve problems. Its about having that motivation to work hard and fight for that coveted IIM seat. You get that motivation here in plenty. I believe that motivation alone will make all the difference in the end.I scored 90 percentile in CAT this year(certainly not what i desired or deserved).Perhaps it was just a day of mediocre performance. Sri Ganesh is an Alumni of IIM-C & I don`t think i need to explain more about the pedigree of the teacher. Me and all my friends, who studied at Dream Chasers, are satisfied and happy about having joined at Dream Chasers of all others.

Vaidyanathan -97.99 percentile in CAT 2008 -IMT Ghaziabad 2011 batch Full time Student of Dream Chasers</p>
<p style="color:gray;">Hi Everyone, Am Vaidyanathan,currently working in an IT co...I was part of the first batch of dream chasers and the practice that i got there was instrumental in me landing up with a job..But more than dat,I think its worth mentioning Mr.Sriganesh`s efforts in grooming to take up the CAT exam..He was one of the cornerstone of my success in this years CAT (2008) exam. The kind of mentorship which i received (which every one @ Dream Chasers would receive) is second to none. His expertise and vast knowledge of the intricacies of the CAT exam,assimilated through years of following the exam, might not be available with the tutors of the well known MBA coaching institutes..And also he has been refining his teaching approach and his course materials are in line with the current trends of the exam and all this can be experienced by getting in touch with and enrolling into his CAT coaching.
</p>

Arul Vel Arasan -IIFT (2010-2012 batch)- Panimalar College of Engg. (2008 batch C.Sc) </p>
<p style="color:gray;">I am Arul. I am working in Cognizant Technology Solutions as a Software engineer.If I would have not met a great person named Mr. Sriganesh of Dream Chasers at right time I would have been a normal Software engineer throughout my life without having any big goals to achieve. Yes, its true. I know Mr. Sriganesh for the past 6 years. Its he who motivated me to take CAT and top B-School exams. Initially I thought that I could not clear such difficult exams because of my not so good educational background. But he is a dynamic force of motivation, and whenever I speak to him I felt much more motivated and he made me to improve in all aspects. I can say he is a maestro in Maths, English, Group discussion and Interview training. Yes, its because of him I have got final admission in one of the reputed B-Schools IIFT(Indian Institute Of Foreign Trade) for MBA in International Business. In my family I am the first person to get a top B-School admission. I know very well that it is Mr. Sriganesh who created a new and competitive destiny for me. I have never seen such a capable person like Mr.Sriganesh. It is he who gave me moral support and training throughout my tiring journey. I am very happy to say that he is the person who made me join the elite group of B-School league. Mr. Sriganesh is a person who makes significant changes in people`s life! Yes, if anyone would like to achieve great goals like clearing CAT and competitive exams Dream Chasers is a best place to get trained, as you get trained directly from IIM Calcutta alumni Mr.Sriganesh. I am very sure that you will never get trained in any other institute directly from IIM graduates.

Vaishnavi -Dhanalakshmi College C.Sc 2009 batch- 93 percentile in CAT 2009 .BIM TRICHY Full time Student of Dream Chasers</p>
<p style="color:gray;">I wish to share my experiences at Dream Chasers too. I became a part of the Dream Chasers institute in Jan `08 for guidance in placement and training. And I must say I got more than just training. I got a mentor-Mr.Sri Ganesh. By all norms he was something exceptional with his simple yet dynamic methods of teaching. He has had a lasting effect on me and it turned out to be a place where I learnt the value of hardwork. He inspired me to work hard and trust my abilities and thats how I got into Infosys(My dream company) in the campus recruitment. Later, in order to equip myself better I wanted to earn an MBA degree and had a go at CAT in `08 with training from one of the so called leading institutes in CAT(since there was not much of an option, back then Dream Chasers was not offering CAT training) and ended up getting 81 percentile. I was badly wounded from my first fall that i decided never to give CAT again in my life. But Mr.Sri Ganesh encouraged me to go for it, under his dedicated training and guidance I made it once again. Got 93 percentile last year and got into IMT Nagpur. All through this journey there was not a moment where we the students of Dreams Chasers(Ones with real aspiration and urge to achieve something) have been left alone. I believe anyone can make their best dreams come true under his guidance coupled with hard work. "You are responsible for what you are and you can shape your life today if you wish. Go get your dreams.

<p style="color:gray;">The one thing I did for getting placed in a good company is joining Dream Chasers. I chased my dream and got it on october 25th. I got job in Polaris. Mr. SriGanesh sir helped me to get this. About aptitude session:I was just an average student in doing aptitude then. His shortcuts in solving a problem, which otherwise seems impossible to complete in a minute or less was easy to learn and to remember. About HR session:He taught me how to respond to a interviewer. Believe me this is the most interesting session. It helped me to answer the interviewer in a confident and impressive manner. The answers to the sticky questions of the interviewer is easy to deal with if one attended Mr. SriGanesh sirs` HR session.</p>

I know Sri Ganesh Sir for the past 5 years and I can assure you that you cannot find such a inspiring and motivating guy anywhere. His IIM C credentials speak of it. I joined Dream Chasers in the second batch for Placement training and MBA Verbal Ability. Believe me, the material he provided and the classes he conducted were really good. Some times it would be mind blowing. Apart from regular classes, I used to call him anytime and clarify my doubts and he was always there with the students whenever needed. The knowledge he imparts to us is really tremendous. I recommend everyone to join his CAT Classes to get the maximum attention unlike other Classes where individuality is rare. After-All everyone of us is a Dream Chaser. All the best to all the Dream Chasers.</p>

<p style="color:gray;">"Dream chasers" helped me chase my dream in a rapid pace n made me achieve it too. I have been working with Keane Ind Pvt (Caritor) for nearly 2 yrs. If not for Sriganesh sir, am not sure if i would be in this position to write-up this line. Just a single class would make you feel so good to have gathered a great knowledge. Sir will not only teach u stuffs, but make you discover ur own potential. That`s an amazing part wher u feel so good n motivating when u realize tat u r capable!! And the one thing i admire in him is the way he has keen concern for each n evry single student`s progress (even fr his x-students) and the way he gives attention to each of them is tremendous which i feel is a very tough job n have never seen in any of my tutors before..

Placed in CTS- Valliammai Engineering college 2009 batch Dreamchasers-The Guide to achieve our dreams</p>
<p style="color:gray;">Hi, I`m Rajesh, pursuing my final year B.E.-E.E.E in Valliammai Engineering College. I joined Dreamchasers in April, 2008 to begin my GRE preparation. I reaped an immediate harvest by getting placed in my campus recruitment in CTS. Mr.Sriganesh is a dynamic rare multitalented person who has a will to realise his dream of motivating students towards their goals in competitive exams, be it GRE or CAT, GMAT, TANCET or CRT. The 600+ problems he solved during the class hours guided me to get past the aptitude test in my CRT and the 3500+ words he taught render immense help for GRE aspirants. No other coaching class renders such high individual attention on students. He is one of the greatest persons I met in my life. I pray and wish his Dreamchasers becomes more popular with student.</p>
