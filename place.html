<p class="cap2" style="font-size: 25px;color:#101c73;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;text-transform: capitalize;"><strong>Why should you join Dream Chasers</strong></p>
<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#000000;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">1.The most important reason for joining a centre is the faculty. In Dream Chasers the training is done by a highly experienced IIM Alumnus who is training students full time and is giving great results year after year. Ask yourself if you would like to learn from the best faculty or from someone who is free on that day (Check the educational qualification of the faculty in other centres and you will see the difference)
	</div></p>
<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#095ae5;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">2.Students have to attend classes till the faculty is satisfied that the students have learnt all the concepts.Here even after the course is over, we ask all the students to come to class and attend the chapters again and again till we are satisfied and the students are satisfied. We will not send the student away saying the topics have been done or so many hours are over but we will keep training them till they become good.(Even if it takes twice the normal duration or thrice the normal duration ,they have to attend till they learn all concepts). Hundreds of students have got results as this is not done by other centres. Other centres have fixed duration like 6 weeks after which the students should leave.Here we make students come for 3 or 4 months also if required and make them successful.
</div></p>
<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#000000;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">3.Personalised attention is given to all the students in the class .Everyday ,we will give the students a target to finish and come before the next class which if followed will give results. We will follow up with each student on how much they have finished
</div></p>
<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#095ae5;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">4.Revision of basic concepts for weak students at no extra fees..
</div></p>
<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#000000;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">5.Excellent Feedback of old students.See feedback of our old students by going to the feedback section

</div></p>
<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#000000;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">6.Free demo class for you to assess the faculty . Then you can pay. So you can be sure there is no risk .
</div></p>
<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#095ae5;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">7.Video recordings of all important chapters are there in our centre. The student can view the video in the centre and revise tough chapters many times. No other centre offers this
</div></p>
<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#000000;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">8.15 hours every week till you become good. By attending so many hours every week,you will surely become good. In 1 month you would have attended 60 hours in class and you can attend more till you become good at no extra fees

I joined placement training by June 1st week and was very much worried about placements as i was completely blank on the various aptitude problems and logical questions. The time left with me was also very low, so i was very much worried. But i was clarified and Sri Ganesh sir is just awesome. He made me confident to attend interviews. On the day of placements i could find myself a step ahead from others , its because i was able to solve the aptitude problems and logical questions very easily while the others were suffering and i taught them the easy methods which sir taught me!! As the name says, this institute really made me to realize my long term dream. I chased my dreams and dreamchasers made it true. All the best freshers. THANK U SO MUCH SIR!!

I have undergone training in this (DREAM CHASERS) centre for placement, which covered aptitude, English and technical. The aptitude session was really useful and interactive when compared to practicing our self. We were taken individual care through which we were able to find our strong and weak chapters which made us to practice more . We were not only taught to find the correct answer , we were also taught to find the correct answers , within the time limit. Practise tests were also conducted in the class and the answers were discussed in the class,from which we were able to find where we are , when compared to others. Short cuts and how to remember the concept were also taught, which made us to be thorough in the concept before we leave the class. Flexible timings were there. And we were also allowed to attend the classes again , to revise. In the english session, we were taught how to remember words . This session also covered grammer. Tests were also conducted. Then the technical session was taught in a way which was easily understandable even by non IT students. The HR session made us to know , how to answer in a way the recruiter expects. Sample interview was conducted which made us confident to face the actual interview. I am very thankful to this center, which made me to know my potential.

The one thing I did for getting placed in a good company is joining Dream Chasers. I chased my dream and got it on october 25th. I got job in Polaris. Mr. SriGanesh sir helped me to get this. About aptitude session:I was just an average student in doing aptitude then. His shortcuts in solving a problem, which otherwise seems impossible to complete in a minute or less was easy to learn and to remember. About HR session:He taught me how to respond to a interviewer. Believe me this is the most interesting session. It helped me to answer the interviewer in a confident and impressive manner. The answers to the sticky questions of the interviewer is easy to deal with if one attended Mr. SriGanesh sirs` HR session.

Hi, folks... am working for isoft. Dream chasers is an institute which gave me a lot of confidence to find a place in an IT firm. The support and guidance which sir gave us was really extraordinary... He solves more number of problems and gives individual attention. He makes us very clear with each and every topic we work on. Sri ganesh sir not only focuses on aptitude, but also on the HR questions. Since, i joined his class after my final sem exams... thought i was lost in the crowd. But, the way he motivated us was really brilliant. Gives a lot of confidence which is the most primary factor to fetch a job. I am really happy and proud be his student.

Hi I am Sandhya, have joined Dream chasers last year and now I got placed in Virtusa. I`m very happy about it. I have no words to explain the sincere efforts taken by Sriganesh sir. Whenever I remember him, the main thing that comes to my mind is his motivational words, confidence and the ability to take up challenges. After finishing my course in Dream Chasers, I was not only carrying the aptitude skills along with me, butalso raised with full confidence, which made me to get recruited in a nice company. Thanks a lot sir

Hi. I`m Subha. I joined Dream Chasers in 2007 for aptitude training and got my placement in CTS. I attended the class for 40 days, learnt a lot and gained enough confidence to face any typical interview. SriGanesh sir made me to understand every problem in the study material. Every class was interesting. He always paid special attention and focussed on every individual student. He is a dedicated, perfect and a very sincere teacher.

Hi Dream Chasers, This is Navaneeth working for TCS, Mumbai. I know Sri Ganesh Sir for the past 5 years and I can assure you that you cannot find such a inspiring and motivating guy anywhere. His IIM C credentials speak of it. I joined Dream Chasers in the second batch for Placement training and MBA Verbal Ability. Believe me, the material he provided and the classes he conducted were really good. Some times it would be mind blowing. Apart from regular classes, I used to call him anytime and clarify my doubts and he was always there with the students whenever needed. The knowledge he imparts to us is really tremendous. I recommend everyone to join his CAT Classes to get the maximum attention unlike other Classes where individuality is rare. After-All everyone of us is a Dream Chaser. All the best to all the Dream Chasers.

"Dream chasers" helped me chase my dream in a rapid pace n made me achieve it too. I have been working with Keane Ind Pvt (Caritor) for nearly 2 yrs. If not for Sriganesh sir, am not sure if i would be in this position to write-up this line. Just a single class would make you feel so good to have gathered a great knowledge. Sir will not only teach u stuffs, but make you discover ur own potential. That`s an amazing part wher u feel so good n motivating when u realize tat u r capable!! And the one thing i admire in him is the way he has keen concern for each n evry single student`s progress (even fr his x-students) and the way he gives attention to each of them is tremendous which i feel is a very tough job n have never seen in any of my tutors before..
