<p class="cap2" style="font-size: 25px;color:#101c73;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;text-transform: capitalize;"><strong>Why should you join Dream Chasers</strong></p>
<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#000000;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">1.The most important reason for joining a centre is the faculty.
 In Dream Chasers the training is done by a highly experienced IIM Alumnus who is training students full time and is giving great results year after year. 
 Ask yourself if you would like to learn from the best faculty or from someone who is free on that day (Check the educational qualification of the faculty 
 in other centres and you will see the difference)</p>
</div>


<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#095ae5;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">2.Personalised planning by IIM Alumni. In Dream Chasers,we will keep track of the progress made by each person and we will give targets for each week.(on an individual basis). Targets will be different for different students. We will make a customised plan for each person after talking to the person and knowing their strengths and weaknesses. If a person works according to the plan ,they will achieve their potential.This is very crucial towards success .In other centres, you do not get any individual plans.</p>
</div>

<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#000000;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">3.Excellent Peer group - We take only serious students . The entire batch will be highly competitive and ambitious. Students will find the company of other ambitious students which will lead to healthy competition.</div>

<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#095ae5;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">4.We encourage extremely good students to go ahead of their group by allowing them to attend classes with the group of students who had joined earlier and also through the use of videos..Here,we encourage people to compare themselves with the best students who had started earlier than them and to try to catch up with them.In other centres,extremely good students will go at the pace of the average students in their batch.</div>



<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#000000;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">5.3000 sums are done in class. (This is way more than what is done in other centres). 2000 words in audio files with meaning and usage will be given to you (you can copy it on to your mobile and listen)so that you do not waste time even when you are travelling to your college or workplace</p>
</div>

<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#095ae5;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">6.Important chapters are done multiple times and students are allowed to attend classes with other groups for topics that they want to revise. Sometimes, a person might not be well and might have missed classes or he/she might be late for class or might not have been able to concentrate in a class. By taking all the important topics again and again and allowing students to watch videos,we make sure that the person does not miss a single topic. This is very crucial to get top scores</div>

<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#000000;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">7.Free demo class for you to assess the faculty . Then you can pay. So you can be sure that you are comfortable with our style of teaching. Hence there is no risk. In other centres,, you will not even be sure of the faculty who will be taking classes. Some of them will be good. Others will be average .The comfort factor with the faculty is very important</div>

<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#095ae5;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">8.Video recordings of all important chapters are there in our centre. The student can view the video in the centre and revise tough chapters many times.. Apart from this, 1300 questions from the last 15 years of CAT have been recorded and this will be given to the students for studying at home. The toughest questions can be revised again and again. No other centre offers this</div>

<div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#000000;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">9.Results : Our selection percentage is way higher than any other centre
</div>
 <div class="boreder"<p style="font-size:18px;color:#095ae5;font-family:Alegreya SC;text-align:center;font-weight:1;">10. We are committed to get you a top score. If you attend 90 % of our classes and you do not get 90 percentile ,we will train you for one more year without taking fees. We believe in our methodology and hence we are offering this. You can check if any other centre is offering this. Call us at 9941436511 to get the exact details

<div class="boreder"><p style="font-family: Alegreya; line-height:1.0;font-size:20px;color:#0a4b9b;padding:10px;">
Hi,

Life is difficult . You cannot make it big in life unless you are willing to work extremely hard. There are no Shortcuts.Face the truth.You can rust out or you can wear out. Once you have accepted that you have to work very hard in life, the most important thing is to choose your direction. Identify what you want in life and fight hard to make it come true. I believe that Everyone has within him/her the potential for greatness. But it will remain just a potential,unless you turn it into reality. You must have the belief that you can become great someday- that you can go to the top .For this ,you must identify your strengths/interest and then get the best possible guidance . If you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid. You must play to your strengths to go to the top. A lot of successful people decided at some point in their life, that they will become successful.It is a choice- a decision to succeed- to leave the past failures behind and to chart a new path. So make a choice today. Decide to play to your strength in the game of life.Take your first step with confidence. Failure might come but one day you will make it to the top -if you do not quit and if you get the best guidance towards your goal. "

If getting into IIM is your interest and your first step towards your life goals, I will do my best to make it come true.I cannot guarantee that you will get into IIM but I will push you hard,I will give you the best possible guidance that can be given,the best possible teaching that anyone can give .I will become your mentor.I will make sure you achieve excellence But I need your commitment to work extremely hard- to give your best shot irrespective of what has happened in your past- to face life with guts - to become passionate about what you do.. I will be with you and push you till you go to the top (as much as I can). There are only 2 kinds of pain. The pain you get when you work long and hard hours and the pain you get when you do not work hard enough and see everyone beat you .Eitherways ,pain is inevitable. You must choose which pain you want. Become passionate about your goal. Sleep is not important-Pride is. So when you feel like going to sleep every night ask yourself if you gave the maximum possible effort-if you did not put in the maximum effort ,resolve to work very hard the next day. As a great person said "Dreams is not what you see in sleep.It is the thing that does not allow you to sleep." I have guided so many students and have helped them achieve their dreams and it is always a pleasure to make a very good student into an exceptional performer and a privilege to know hardworking people. Do come and meet me . I will help you Chase your dreams. Wish you live a great life .

With passion,

S.Sriganesh</p></div>

Sandeep Ramachandran -99.81 Percentile in CAT 2016 -Final offer from IIM Ahmedabad and many IIMs .Joining IIM A in PGP 2017 -2019 batch- Full time Student of Dream Chasers
B.E. (ECE)-2016 batch- SSN college of Engineering 
</p><p style="color:gray;">
My tryst with CAT started when I joined Dreamchasers in January 2015. Right from the demo class, Sriganesh sir took a lot of care in making sure that his students were thorough with the topics handled in class that day. He would be very patient in resolving even the smallest of doubts that any of his students might have. One can sense the passion sir has for teaching. Not only was he a brilliant teacher, but also a constant source of support and motivation during times of self-doubt. He always instilled the confidence in all of his students that we can make our dreams a reality. Another important advantage is that Dreamchasers also has a very high quality of students - group study sessions also often motivated me in performing that little bit better. I was dejected when I could not secure admission into one of my dream institutes despite scoring a 98.57 percentile in CAT 2015. Sriganesh sir however made me believe in myself and provided me with the additional thrust and support system during my second attempt at the CAT. He would provide personalised attention, constantly keep tabs on my progress and motivate me to push harder to attain my targets. All these cumulatively helped me score a 99.81 in CAT 2016 and fetched me calls from IIMs . I was given invaluable tips to succeed in the interviews that followed - I was able to secure admission into IIM Ahmedabad PGP 2017-19. I owe a lot to Sriganesh sir and Dreamchasers for helping me realise my ambitions!

<p style="color:gray;">
I decided to give CAT in my final year of engineering. I knew it was very difficult to crack CAT the first time and to give it my best, I had to find an institute that would push me beyond expectations. I am so happy I made the right decision by choosing Dream Chasers. The demo class was enough for me to be sure of my decision. Sriganesh sir helped in acquiring in-depth knowledge about the subject and made me like what I practiced. Be it the way he teaches or his motivational speeches, most inspired from his own life, he would boost the confidence in you and according to me, self confidence is very important to succeed in CAT and life as well. Professional, passionate and encouraging, Dream Chasers is a place where dreams come true.

B.E. (ECE)-2016 batch- SSN college of Engineering </p>

<p style="color:gray;">Hi, I must be honest that it is the Dream Chasers program that really made me perform well in CAT 2016.The program at Dream Chasers has been very personalized.I was directly able to interact with Sri Ganesh Sir and receive inputs specific to my strengths and weaknesses. His methods of teaching were simply amazing and made me tackle CAT level problems.I remember my every doubt getting clarified from the first to the last minute.The classes first focussed on revision of basics and then moved to advanced level relevant to CAT. This is something unique to Dream Chasers, where they do not overload a beginner. In the last three months,previous year CAT papers were also discussed.Every section of CAT was given equal importance and personalized feedback was provided by Sriganesh Sir every week.I would definitely recommend to people who are serious about getting into IIM.

B.E.Aeronautical Engineering (2013 batch) Madras Institute of Technology </p>
<p style="color:gray;">
I scored 99.48 percentile in CAT 2012. I've got calls from all 13 IIMs. I came to know of Dream Chasers through one of my seniors in college. Mr.SriGanesh is an extremely passionate person. His motivational speeches have played a great part in keeping my thoughts high and my feet grounded. Everyone starting out on their preparation for CAT will be putting in more effort at the start. But only those who are willing to toil till the end perform well. Mr. Sriganesh has always told about the importance of working hard till the end. In the initial stages of my preparation,he taught me different ways of improving my speed in mathematics as well as in reading articles of different categories. As the preparation progressed he taught the various nuances of writing the mock exams. Individual attention is given for every individual in the class.He has also taken classes on the basics of finance which has helped me in the interviews..I hope that his classes reach out to many more students and helps them to realize their dreams

Shruthy -99.53 percentile in CAT 2011 - Final offers from 10 IIM's - Joined IIM Calcutta -Full time Student of Dream Chasers
National University of Singapore C.Sc. 2011 batch</p>
<p style="color:gray;">I attended CAT classes in Dream Chasers.. And I am really glad that I made that choice. As I was studying in Singapore, I could not attend classes throughout the year, so Sri Ganesh helped me by taking special classes for me, so that I'd be familiar with all topics during the three months I was in Chennai. Even after I left to SIngapore, Sri Ganesh took revision classes for me over Skype and was constantly updated about my progress and study plan. Not only is his teaching great, but Sri Ganesh also ensures that all his students are comfortable with his pace, and students are always welcome to ask questions or express difficulties. Individual attention was given to all of us and special guidance was given to tackle the topics we were weak in. Sincerity and passion are greatly valued in Dream Chasers. Sri Ganesh also ensures that all topics are covered and students take adequate number of mocks before the D-Day. He has been a great source of motivation and inspiration, and more than everything else, a very good friend. Dream Chasers provided me with the necessary knowledge and confidence which helped me score 99.57 percentile in CAT, which helped me fetch calls from 10 IIMs. I hope Dream Chasers reaches out to many more students and many more students are able to realize their dreams.

Akila - Calls from 10 IIMs Joined IIM Lucknow 2015 - 2017 batch
Madras Institute of Technology- Computer Science Engineering 2011-15 batch </p>
<p style="color:gray;">I came to know about this institute through my college seniors who insisted me to join Dream chasers. I joined in August 2013. I would say that it was the best decision I have taken in my life. I was a completely different person after I joined there. Sri Ganesh sir is more than a guru to me he is a close friend, a mentor. I was a typical engineering person when I joined Dreamchasers. Sir changed me into an IIM material. I would feel ashamed if I have not learnt for a day or if I sleep before 1 - thats the level of motivation sir gives his students. He is 100% willing to spend extra time with his students to work on their weaknesses. He will give weekly schedule depending on our strengths and weakness. He also ensures that we follow it by making calls in-between. He would personally motivate each of his students by making frequent calls and that made me push harder and harder. Another factor is the kind of peer group. Sir had a limited number of students and each person there was a reflection of the real competition I was going to face. Initially I was afraid but the learnings I got from them was even more valuable. He is such a passionate teacher and an inspirational orator. I spent the entire year in his classes. Saturday and Sunday in T-nagar and on weekdays if I feel I am not working hard I would go to his Chrompet classes and he would make sure I achieve my target. Even during the summer holidays I rented a hostel outside college and sir took classes for me every day just to make me more confident. Dream chasers is the place where my life got transformed. I had low self-confidence and was not sure whether I would clear CAT when I joined sirs classes. But I ended up with 10 IIM calls including Bangalore and converted IIM Lucknow. I cannot express my entire feelings in words. I assure you your dreams will be realized if you join this institute. All you have to do is join. That was my case he ensures that we achieve big in life. My lifes journey started in the 5th floor of Challa mall. You can find yours too. All the best guys.

Mano Venkatesh- 96.19 percentile in CAT 2016 .Offer from IIM Calcutta and other IIM's Joining IIM Calcutta 2017 - 2019 batch
B.E. Electrical and Electronics Engineering at SSN College of Engineering 2017 batch </p>
<p style="color:gray;">A quick intro about me : Class X 9.6CGPA, Class XII 93.8%(CBSE), B.E. EEE at SSN College of Engineering, Chennai (CGPA 7.7 until 7th semester). Cat 2016 : 96.19 Percentile I am fresher. I have just completed my under graduation. Got calls from IIM A,C,L,I,K and new IIMs. Converted Calcutta and Lucknow as of now. My college gives students a lot of freedom to pursue what they want to inside the campus. The student run culturals, Techfests, Melas let me try my hand at marketing. I loved it. I thought I would be happy pursuing marketing as my career. That's when I came to know about CAT. I went through the portions and I knew I was quite comfortable with the portions as such, but CAT is a competitive examination. The competition is unbelievable. So I knew more than just a tutor, I wanted a mentor to guide me through my preparation. That's when I came to know about Mr.Sri Ganesh sir. I spoke to him and immediately realised that he is the type of mentor I was looking for. Mr.Sri Ganesh is a huge source of motivation. Whenever you feel low (If you do not feel low during your course of preparation, it means you aren't preparing well), just give him a call and you will feel much better. He believes in hardwork. We students at Dream Chasers got individual attention. Whenever I was wasting time , he was there to tell me that I was lagging behind. He calls you at 10 pm at night to ask if I am following the time table. We hardly get such attention from teachers nowadays. This is where Dreamchasers stands out from the crowd. Except for few self motivated students, majority of us will not sit at home and study for 10 hours on weekends. But sir made us sit in the class for 10 hours each (on Saturday and Sunday) weekend after weekend.These are the little things which help us edge ahead of the competition. In my opinion, time spent studying at home will be crucial for success in CAT or any competitive exams for that reason. So to have a mentor guiding you in your preparation at home, is an added advantage. I don't see that happening in other leading coaching centers. These things might seem intimidating for an aspirant just starting his preparation . So to just let you guys know, we enjoyed our preparation. The Dream Chasers centre in T Nagar is where we spent our weekends in, we had fun great fun during the breaks and at times during the preparation time too. We helped each other even though we were all competing with each other. I loved my days at DC. Thanks to Agni anna and Ganga akka too for being there. Finally thanks to Sri Ganesh sir for being my mentor and not just a tutor. I am happy being your junior at IIM C sir. You will definitely scale great heights sir. Best wishes.

Keerthi Raj - Got Final Offers from IIM Indore and other IIMs in CAT 2014.- Joined IIM Indore 2015 -2017 batch</p>
<p style="color:gray;">I joined Dream Chasers after my close friend recommended me to join this Institute.I attended the demo class of our mentor Mr.Sriganesh. I was impressed with his way of teaching and I believed that this is the place for me to prepare for my CAT exam. Reasons why I preferred Dream Chasers over other coaching institutes are 1. Personal attention from the mentor. 2. Motivation 3. Competitive peer group .I strongly felt that I had the potential to clear CAT exam. But I was searching for a mentor who can guide and motivate me to study. Fortunately I cameto meet Sriganesh sir. He motivated and inspired me to prepare for this exam. Unfortunately I didn't clear CAT'13 even after preparing so well. I joined Dream Chasers again for CAT'14 because I trusted in Mr. Sriganesh's credentials. He was so kind that he didn't charge a single rupee for CAT'14. And this time I realised my dream of pursuing my MBA in IIM. I thank Sriganesh sir for inspiring me and acting as a pillar of support throughout the 2 and half yrs. I recommend people who want to achieve big in life to join Dream Chasers.I am sure you will also realize your dream come true. All the best. Good luck. Thank you.

IIM Trichy and multiple offers from IIM's -Joined IIM trichy 2014 -2016 batch Full time Student of Dream Chasers</p>
<p style="color:gray;">I joined Dreamchasers in Feb 13, after having spent 6 months at one of the many generic CAT coaching centers in the city. What really sets dreamchasers apart is their focus on sustained hard work, and Sriganesh sir's genuine desire to see each of his students succeed. Sir's teaching is unparalleled, he ensures that important topics are covered numerous times over the course of the year, and ensures that each student has understood the core concepts before moving on the next topic. Sir provides personalized weekly goals to each student, designed to push your limits and make you work harder than you ever have. At Dreamchasers you'll find some of the most dedicated and hardworking students. The competitive spirit in the classes is highly infectious, and provides even more motivation to study harder.Sir is a firm believer in the power of hard work, throughout my CAT journey, he told me that as long as we work as hard as we can each day, nothing can stop us from achieving our goals. I scored 98.6 percentile in CAT, and got calls from 6 IIMs. None of that would have been possible without Dreamchasers, and the confidence and motivation that Sir has provided.

Vijayaraj 96.99 percentile in CAT 2013 Madras Institute of Technology -Aeronautical Engineering 2012 batch -Joined IIM Calcutta 2014 -2016 batch
 - Final offer from Multiple IIM's - Full time Student of Dream Chasers</p>
<p style="color:gray;">I am vijayaraj.As I studied in Tamil medium I was not very good at verbal and aptitude. I didn't have trust in my own abilities and the level of self-confidence in my own abilities was very low. I always thought that I could not clear CAT exam and it looked like an impossible task for me. But after I met MR.SRIGANESH (mentor in DREAM CHASERSÅ¥) things totally changed. A new self-confidence was born inside me (after seeing his way of teaching and speaking.) I came to believe that everything could be achieved through serious hard work - it does not matter if you are talented or not. My efforts increased to nearly 10 hrs per day mainly because of his motivational and inspirational speech and good guidance. Since my childhood I have not met such a motivational speaker and influential person in my life. His personalised care for each student has helped me much (to clarify the doubts I had). Now I couldn't believe myself, I cleared CAT and ended up with eight calls from IIMs (IIM-Bangalore, Kozhikode and six new IIMs).So I suggest that if anyone wants to achieve their dream, there is no other place like DREAM CHASERSÅ¥ in the world.

Vikram Tanwar -Interview Calls from 6 IIM's in CAT 2012 - Full time Student of Dream Chasers
BVB College of Engg. 2011 batch-Automobile Engineering</p>
<p style="color:gray;">I came to know about Dream Chasers when I was searching in Google and after doing my bit of research I Contacted SriGanesh Sir. Before this I had joined a large centre and as I was not satisfied with the mode and quality of education provided there I decided to meet Sir. After the first meeting itself I was sure that I will join Dream Chasers. Other than the positivity associated with the institute even the curriculum and the timings absolutely matched my requirements.When I came under Sir's guidance I had only 3 months left for the CAT examination and had a lot to cover. Working professionals trying to pursue academics have serious time constraints. I, being one was facing similar challenges. But I had the option of attending weekend classes at a stretch where Sir would complete a module and then I had the entire week to work upon it post which I went back to him with my queries. He believes in learning by doing and that is what we did. Practice makes a man perfect and helps in scoring well in CAT is what I imbibed from his classes. The fact that Sir has himself written CAT and is an Alumnus of IIM CAlcutta helps a lot. Wonderful experiences of his time which he shared with us helped me a lot. The motivation factor did not just end with the class. We received status calls from Sir on a regular basis and my performance was kept on a regular scrutiny. We discussed my strengths and weaknesses on one to one basis and worked upon those. We were provided with videos on various topics which helped us to revise and recollect the important points in a much efficient and quicker way. Having someone learned and experienced analyze your performance and work on a common goal with you is a very crucial element in anyone's preparation. I am very satisfied with the amount of personal attention and encouragement which I got throughout my duration in Dream Chasers. Apart from CAT preparation Sir has always been a colossal source of inspiration for me on the personal front as well. I somehow have connected with him in a very positive manner and even now I often turn to him in order to seek his advice. His thought process, his ideologies, his experiences and his attitude towards life has inspired me in a very positive way. His sublime presence has revamped my attitude making it more zealous and optimistic..I would recommend every serious CAT aspirant to join his classes

Indore and all New IIMs - Part time student of Dream Chasers.</p>
<p style="color:gray;">Sriganesh Sir has guided me on every step of my CAT journey . The interest he took in my improvement, the constant progress reviews, and his unfailing motivation has certainly made all the difference for me. I had a very short time frame of 2 months to prepare for and crack CAT. Sir understood my potential and my needs and helped me strategize my preparation of the concepts and the art of taking mock exams. Based on the constant interaction and feedback that I got from Sir, I was able to see a marked improvement in my solving approach and my scores. I also found his videos on Quantitative concepts to be very useful. Post CAT, Sir also helped me prepare for my Interviews, Group Discussions and Written Ability Tests in a very structured manner - so much so that I was able to make it to the first shortlist of every single institute which gave me a call. I can say that I owe my spot at IIM-L entirely to Sir.

<p style="color:gray;">I joined Dream Chasers in August 2013 and it was a really good decision. I got to know of the classes from people in my college. I attended the demo class and I was sure to join because of the clarity of the concepts. Sriganesh sir has been a great mentor and guide. He has always pushed me to do better and even in times of difficulty, he encouraged me to never give up. The reason his classes are better than others is because of the attention he provides to each student. He helped each one of us develop a comprehensive plan for preparation. I am extremely thankful to him as I could crack CAT, IIFT and NMAT. He also helped us keep in touch with current affairs topics. I hope that Dream Chasers reaches out to many students and sir can fulfill his passion of helping students achieve their goals.

<p style="color:gray;">I am Arul. I am working in Cognizant Technology Solutions as a Software engineer.If I would have not met a great person named Mr. Sriganesh of Dream Chasers at right time I would have been a normal Software engineer throughout my life without having any big goals to achieve. Yes, its true. I know Mr. Sriganesh for the past 6 years. Its he who motivated me to take CAT and top B-School exams. Initially I thought that I could not clear such difficult exams because of my not so good educational background. But he is a dynamic force of motivation, and whenever I speak to him I felt much more motivated and he made me to improve in all aspects. I can say he is a maestro in Maths, English, Group discussion and Interview training. Yes, its because of him I have got final admission in one of the reputed B-Schools IIFT(Indian Institute Of Foreign Trade) for MBA in International Business. In my family I am the first person to get a top B-School admission. I know very well that it is Mr. Sriganesh who created a new and competitive destiny for me. I have never seen such a capable person like Mr.Sriganesh. It is he who gave me moral support and training throughout my tiring journey. I am very happy to say that he is the person who made me join the elite group of B-School league. Mr. Sriganesh is a person who makes significant changes in people`s life! Yes, if anyone would like to achieve great goals like clearing CAT and competitive exams Dream Chasers is a best place to get trained, as you get trained directly from IIM Calcutta alumni Mr.Sriganesh. I am very sure that you will never get trained in any other institute directly from IIM graduates.

Vaidyanathan -97.99 percentile in CAT 2008 -IMT Ghaziabad 2011 batch Full time Student of Dream Chasers</p>
<p style="color:gray;">Hi Everyone, Am Vaidyanathan,currently working in an IT co...I was part of the first batch of dream chasers and the practice that i got there was instrumental in me landing up with a job..But more than dat,I think its worth mentioning Mr.Sriganesh`s efforts in grooming to take up the CAT exam..He was one of the cornerstone of my success in this years CAT (2008) exam. The kind of mentorship which i received (which every one @ Dream Chasers would receive) is second to none. His expertise and vast knowledge of the intricacies of the CAT exam,assimilated through years of following the exam, might not be available with the tutors of the well known MBA coaching institutes..And also he has been refining his teaching approach and his course materials are in line with the current trends of the exam and all this can be experienced by getting in touch with and enrolling into his CAT coaching.

Vaishnavi -Dhanalakshmi College C.Sc 2009 batch- 93 percentile in CAT 2009 .BIM TRICHY Full time Student of Dream Chasers</p>
<p style="color:gray;">I wish to share my experiences at Dream Chasers too. I became a part of the Dream Chasers institute in Jan `08 for guidance in placement and training. And I must say I got more than just training. I got a mentor-Mr.Sri Ganesh. By all norms he was something exceptional with his simple yet dynamic methods of teaching. He has had a lasting effect on me and it turned out to be a place where I learnt the value of hardwork. He inspired me to work hard and trust my abilities and thats how I got into Infosys(My dream company) in the campus recruitment. Later, in order to equip myself better I wanted to earn an MBA degree and had a go at CAT in `08 with training from one of the so called leading institutes in CAT(since there was not much of an option, back then Dream Chasers was not offering CAT training) and ended up getting 81 percentile. I was badly wounded from my first fall that i decided never to give CAT again in my life. But Mr.Sri Ganesh encouraged me to go for it, under his dedicated training and guidance I made it once again. Got 93 percentile last year and got into IMT Nagpur. All through this journey there was not a moment where we the students of Dreams Chasers(Ones with real aspiration and urge to achieve something) have been left alone. I believe anyone can make their best dreams come true under his guidance coupled with hard work. "You are responsible for what you are and you can shape your life today if you wish. Go get your dreams.

Thenral Ramalingam SIIB Pune Full time Student of Dream Chasers</p>
<p style="color:gray;">I am Thenral Ramalingam. After completing my Engineering at Sona College of Technology at Salem, I was working with Infosys Ltd at Chennai. I came across Dream Chasers website when I was searching for a coaching center to train for exams like CAT/XAT/SNAP. I was in a dilemma owing to the long distance to the center from the place I live in Chennai. But, after I attended the demo class, I had no second thoughts and joined with Dream Chasers immediately. The personal attention and keeping up of how far we have progressed in our learning, is something only Sriganesh sir could do. I can say it for a fact that, this allowed me to fare better than I would, if I were attending some other coaching center. The journey of about eight months of learning with sir was extraordinary. As I was working, I had no idea of how I was going to manage both going for work and preparing for exams. The motivation and support that sir gave, kept me going whenever I felt it hard. I owe my success of getting into Symbiosis Institute of International Business, Pune for MBA International Business to Sriganesh sir and Dream Chasers.Å¥

Ieswariya -Sairam Engineering College E & I 2013 batch - 98.17 in MAT </p>
<p style="color:gray;">I am k.ieswariya.I am doing my final year engineering in Sri Sairam engineering college, Chennai. Dream ChasersÅ¥ was just another word till I met Mr.Sriganesh.I could still remember the evening when I first met him along with my parents in his class. Till then I didn't have any goals or big aims in my life. On that day he talked to me for two hours. He made me realize what I needed in my life and what I should do to achieve it. I joined in dream chasers for MBA class on January 8th 2011.He taught me so well still I could recollect all the maths concepts. Other than that every day in class he used to discuss regarding the happenings around the world, so it added to my general knowledge also. In India, Most of the training institutes have become money minded but dream chaser is definitely not of that kind. It's more like a family where u get so much of encouragements and support always.Eventhough I joined for MBA entrance he also helped me for my campus interview. Sir gave me so many tips and conducted mock interviews, so when I attended the interview it was a cake walk for me and now I got placed in TCS.The very first success in my life and I owe it completely to Mr.Sri ganesh.I had my MAT(MANAGEMENT APTITUDE TEST) followed by my campus and I was really scared to write it because it was my first competitive exam, But sir gave me all the confidence to write it and daily he used to call and encouraged me and I finally got 98.17 percentile. Can we expect this kind of encouragement from any other training institutes? Answer would be definitely a big no. It was a turning point in my life. Now I got MBA admission into a prestigious university in Banglore.whatever I am in my life is definitely because of Mr.Sriganesh and Dream chasers. I am proud to be a part of Dream chaser.

I did not know what will be my future after 3 years of engineering at the end of first year but Mr.Sriganesh guided me and helped me a lot in shaping up my future by giving me the right direction and explaining me the importance of MBA pertaining to the real time scenario. I really admire him for his efforts in making us clear of the concepts and also for the individual attention he gives for each and every student in the class. Dream chasers will definitely help you in making your dream come true if your always ready to chase your dream irrespective of the hurdles that comes your way.

Shyam -IFMR (2010-2012) 90 percentile CAT 2009 -Panimalar College of Engg. (2009 batch)- Full time Student of Dream Chasers</p>
<p style="color:gray;">Hi all, I was a student of Dream Chasers for CAT.I Doubt if I can find a better place for CAT Coaching. There are too many institutes & resources which teach you how to solve quantitative aptitude, Logical reasoning & Data Interpretation problems. Looked at from that perspective, Dream Chasers is certainly among the best ones. Things like conceptual clarity, practice papers and problems, short cut solutions and others that you expect from an excellent institute are here. But performing well in CAT is not just about learning to solve problems. Its about having that motivation to work hard and fight for that coveted IIM seat. You get that motivation here in plenty. I believe that motivation alone will make all the difference in the end.I scored 90 percentile in CAT this year(certainly not what i desired or deserved).Perhaps it was just a day of mediocre performance. Sri Ganesh is an Alumni of IIM-C & I don`t think i need to explain more about the pedigree of the teacher. Me and all my friends, who studied at Dream Chasers, are satisfied and happy about having joined at Dream Chasers of all others.

Chase your Dreams</strong></p>
<div class="textstyle">
I have a friend named Monty Roberts who owns a horse ranch in San Isidro. 
He has let me use his house to put on fund-raising events to raise money for youth at risk programs. 
The last time I was there he introduced me by saying, ’I want to tell you why I let Jack use my horse. It all goes back to a story about a young man who was the son of an itinerant horse trainer who would go from stable to stable, race track to race track, farm to farm and ranch to ranch, training horses. As a result, the boy’s high school career was continually interrupted. When he was a senior, he was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to be and do when he grew up. That night he wrote a seven-page paper describing his goal of someday owning a horse ranch. He wrote about his dream in great detail and he even drew a diagram of a 200-acre ranch, showing the location of all the buildings, the stables and the track. Then he drew a detailed floor plan for a 4,000-square-foot house that would sit on a 200-acre dream ranch. He put a great deal of his heart into the project and the next day he handed it in to his teacher. Two days later he received his paper back. On the front page was a large red F with a note that read, ’See me after class.’ The boy with the dream went to see the teacher after class and asked, ’Why did I receive an F ? ’ The teacher said, `This is an unrealistic dream for a young boy like you. You have no money. You come from an itinerant family. You have no resources. Owning a horse ranch requires a lot of money. You have to buy the land. You have to pay for the original breeding stock and later you’ll have to pay large stud fees. There is no way you could ever do it.’ Then the teacher added, ’If you will rewrite this paper with a more realistic goal, I will reconsider your grade.’ ’The boy went home and thought about it long and hard. He asked his father what he should do. His father said, ’Look, son, you have to make up your own mind on this. However, I think it is a very important decision for you ’ ’Finally, after sitting with it for a week, the boy turned in the same paper, making no changes at all. He stated, ’You can keep the F and I’ll keep my dream.’ Monty then turned to the assembled group and said, ’I tell you this story because you are sitting in my 4,000-square-foot house in the middle of my 200-acre horse ranch. I still have that school paper framed over the fireplace.’ He added, ’ The best part of the story is that two summers ago that same schoolteacher brought 30 kids to camp out on my ranch for a week.’ When the teacher was leaving, he said, ’Look, Monty, I can tell you this now. When I was your teacher, I was something of a dream stealer. 
During those years I stole a lot of kids’ dreams. Fortunately you had enough gumption not to give up on yours’.</div>
